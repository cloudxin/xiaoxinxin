In this exercise, you will simulate the behavior of a switch. Note
that this is just one switch in a potentially much larger extended
LAN, so each port may have many end-hosts reachable through it.
Your program or script should be named "switch", and it will be
invoked as follows:

    ./switch <num ports> <input file>
  
"<num ports>" is the number of ports the switch has (no more than
128), and these should be numbered from 0 to (<num ports> - 1).
"<input file>" will contain a series of lines representing frames
arriving at the switch, which the switch must then forward
appropriately.  Each frame's destination will be the address of a
single host, not a multicast or broadcast address.  Lines will have
the following form:

<port> <dst addr> <src addr>

After each line, your program should print the port number or numbers
(separated by a single space) to which this frame should be forwarded.
The switch begins with no knowledge of the network topology.

For example, a frame coming in on port 3 that should be sent to
port 1 would produce a line containing

1

while a broadcast would produce a line containing (assuming 8 ports)
  
0 1 2 4 5 6 7

Note that the addresses may be arbitrary strings, which is the
easiest way to handle the standard human-readable MAC address format.
