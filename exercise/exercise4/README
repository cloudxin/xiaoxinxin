You will write a program or script named "tcp" which will simulate
TCP's congestion control algorithm (not including Fast Retransmit
or Fast Recovery).  It will be invoked as follows:
  
    ./tcp <MSS> <input file>

The first argument is the maximum segment size for the connection.
The second argument is a file containing a list of lines as follows:
  
 - If the line is a "+", it is an ACK for one MSS of data
 - If the line is a "-", it is a timeout waiting for an ACK
 
Upon first starting, your program should print the current value
of CWND, and nothing else. After reading a line, your program should
print the current value of CWND, and nothing else. Assume your
program begins immediately after the three-way handshake.
