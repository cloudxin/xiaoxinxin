Using a simple testbed containing (at a minumum) nodes named test0
and test1, write a program that creates and sends correctly formatted
ICMP messages of the following types (not in response to incoming
traffic) from test0 to test1:

  Type 0 -- Echo Reply
  Type 11 -- Time Exceeded
  Type 3, Code 4 -- DST Unreachable, Fragmentation Required

The unspecified details for each are left for you to choose.

Your specific testbed should be defined in a file called icmp.yml,
which will be used as input for start_testbed.py.

You must provide an executable named icmp. This may be a script or
compiled.  The test will call make if a Makefile is present, as
well as starting the testbed.
