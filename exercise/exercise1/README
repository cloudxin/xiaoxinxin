CIDR blocks have a canonical form, so while <dotted-quad>/<len>
always unambiguously refers to a specific block, that does not make
it a correct, canonical representation of the block. Write a script
or program (we will run "make" if a Makefile is present in your
submission) named "cidr" that takes a file as its input and produces
canonical CIDR blocks as output. The file will have one block per
line, in the format

    a.b.c.d/n

where a, b, c, d, and n are all numbers. The output should be the
canonical CIDR blocks, in the same order and format. Your program
will be invoked as
  
    ./cidr <filename>
