You will write a program that inspects IP packets and prints some
information about them. The packets should be read in raw pcap
format from a file (such as the output from tcpdump -w), which will
be the sole argument to formatter, an executable you will write.
This may be a script or a compiled program. If you provide a Makefile,
the test will run make first.

The output format should be:

<src> <dst> <len> <proto> ...

In this, <src> and <dst> are the packet source and destination,
<len> is the packet length, <proto> is the Layer 4 protocol, and
anything else is protocol specific.

  * For ICMP, UDP, and TCP, <proto> should be the string "ICMP",
    "UDP", or "TCP".  For any other Layer 4 protocol, print the
    protocol number and do nothing else.

  * For UDP and TCP, the next two fields should be the source
    port and destination port, in that order.

  * For TCP, this should be followed by the flags that are
    set, in their standard 3-letter abbreviations (SYN, ACK, etc.)
    and comma-separated without spaces (eg, "ACK,SYN"), followed
    by the sequence number and acknowledgment number. If either of
    these is not defined, the line should print a "-" instead.
