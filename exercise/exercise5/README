Name Resolution lies at the heart of understanding the Internet.
In this exercise, you will use Scapy to construct DNS packets to
obtain the IP Address of a host name.

Refer to the DNS in-class exercise and become comfortable with the
two built-in commands we use to resolve a hostname's IP address:
``host`` and ``dig``.

Your task consists of writing a client that performs iterative
queries. Note the following points:

1. Identify the components in the DNS Query Response packet and
   print out the Hostname, Record type (A, CNAME, etc.), and IP
   addr.
2. You *must* perform iterative queries (non-recursive), so you
   need to identify how to set this flag in the query packet.
3. You must print out each iterative step (also known as layers).

Your script should be called 'dns' and take in two arguments: 
[-a hostname]
[-n name server IP]

Your output should look similar to the following:

./dns -a search.yahoo.com -n 127.0.1.1
search.yahoo.com. 5 ds-global3.l7.search.ystg1.b.yahoo.com.
ds-global3.l7.search.ystg1.b.yahoo.com. 1 66.218.84.137

./dns -a cs.cornell.edu -n 8.8.8.8
cs.cornell.edu. 1 128.84.96.12
cs.cornell.edu. 1 128.84.96.10
